# Genetic-algorithm-for-process-scheduling
Process scheduling is an essential part of a Multiprogramming operating system.
It plays an important role in overall system performance. 
The process scheduling is the activity of the process manager that handles the removal of the running process from the CPU and the selection of another process on the basis of a particular strategy.
This paper presents a genetic algorithm approach to schedule the processes using the concept of genetics.
As we know, CPU scheduling is an NP Hard problem. Genetic algorithm provides a solution to this NP Hard problem. 
Using this algorithm we obtain the optimal solution.
The algorithm consists of a population of all possible solutions and we calculate the fitness of each chromosome.
Using the concept of genetics that includes calculating fitness, selecting parents, performing a crossover and hence by mutating and replacing in the population repeatedly we obtain the optimal solution to the given problem.
